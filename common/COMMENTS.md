# Code Comments Guide

## What are Code Comments

Code comments are textual explanations used to clarify the purpose and logic of code. They help other developers understand the code's intent and make the code easier to maintain and comprehend.

## Why Code Comments Matter

"If you don't write comments, only you and God know what your code means when you write it, and after a few months, only God knows." Therefore, writing comments not only facilitates good collaboration among team members but also helps your future self.

However, what's more terrifying than no comments is wrong comments. Always strive to write comments that are as clear and accurate as possible.

## Core Principles

### 1. Focus on **WHY** - Explain Intent and Reasoning

Comments should answer "why this approach was chosen" rather than "what this code does."

### 2. Explain **HOW** for Complex Implementations

When algorithms or logic are complex, explain the methodology and key steps.

### 3. Minimize **WHAT** - Avoid Code Repetition

The code itself shows what it does; don't repeat it in comments.

## Summary

Remember: **Code tells you what it does, comments tell you why it does it that way**. Good comments are like letters to future maintainers (including yourself), explaining the decision context and thought process.
